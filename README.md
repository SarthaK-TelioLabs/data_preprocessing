# Data_preprocessing For JIRA Research
This project entails a comprehensive research on various methods to preprocess data for the Jira platform. The study explores standard preprocessing techniques and delves into the integration of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack and Elasticsearch for enhanced data management and search capabilities.
Research Areas
1. Standard Preprocessing Techniques
   * Data Cleaning: Methods for removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data inconsistencies.
   * Data Normalization: Techniques for scaling and transforming data to a uniform format.
   * Data Transformation: Approaches to structuring data for further analysis and processing.
2. ELK Stack Integration
   * Logstash: Data collection and transformation capabilities.
   * Elasticsearch: Efficient data indexing and search functionalities.
   * Kibana: Advanced data visualization and dashboard creation tools.
